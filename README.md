# 🎙️ Speech Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a real-time Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using deep learning techniques.
The model analyzes audio signals and classifies emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, neutral, fear, and surprise**.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Input: Mel-spectrogram features extracted from speech signals

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* Librosa
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## 📂 Dataset

Public speech emotion dataset (e.g., RAVDESS / TESS / SAVEE).
Only dataset structure is provided due to size constraints.

## ⚙️ How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/train.py
python src/predict.py
```

## 📊 Results

* High accuracy in emotion classification
* Real-time emotion detection from audio input

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Deploy as a web application
* Improve accuracy with transformer-based models
